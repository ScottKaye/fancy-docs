# Fancy Document Template
Just install [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/) edit `compile.js` with a few values, and run `node compile watch` to be on your way.

- `style.css` is for the overall style
- `layout.html` is for including other template-related things, where the only thing special is the `$content$` string, which is replaced with parsed markdown
