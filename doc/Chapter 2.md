# More stuff
That header has a class of `darker`, because the image is [too light to have white text.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision))  The full code amounts to this:

```html
<div class="header-image darker" style="background-image: url(images/architecture.jpg)">
</div>
<header>
	<i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i>
	Look At This Picture
	<small>Isn't it great?</small>
</header>
```

This section didn't need to be in a new document, but it's nice to be organized.
